### Hi ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on completing my master's, almost done! I'm studying Electrical and Mechanical Engineering at the University of Strathclyde, where I've gained a passion for robotics.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Reinforcement Learning](https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html), I got into the field through Barto and Sutton, absolutely looking to pursue it as a career!
- âš¡ Fun fact: Banging your head against a wall for one hour burns 150 calories.
