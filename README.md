### Hi o/

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on completing my master's, almost done! I'm studying Electrical and Mechanical Engineering at the University of Strathclyde.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Reinforcement Learning](https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html), studying it has been great.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Banging your head against a wall for one hour burns 150 calories.
